# Mega Hub

Design for network control layer between the dashboard and the subnetwork hubs.

The Mega Hub should:
- Initiate subnetworks using dashboard information
- Issue commands from the dashboard to the correct subnetworks
- Translate network topology into discrete subnetwork alterations
- Eventually, create optimal network topologies based on target power delivered per router
